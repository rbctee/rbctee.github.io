Hi there! My name is **Robert C. Raducioiu** and I'm currently working as a `CyberSecurity` Consultant in Europe (`Italy`).

I spend part of my free time studying topics like:

- `Malware` Analysis
- Exploit Development
- Binary `Exploitation`
- Active Directory Exploitation

But I'm also interested in other subjects, like Scripting (in my own *homelab*), FrontEnd and BackEnd Development. Sometimes, I also participate in `CTF` (*Capture The Flag*) Events, mainly on `HackTheBox` (link below).

Work aside, I'm interested in `Music`; I usually listen to *classical music* from videogame soundtracks (e.g. Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend of Zelda, Nier) or various authors (e.g. Ryuichi Sakamoto, Ludovico Einaudi, Chopin, Erik Satie).

I also like reading `books`, from Japanese Novels focusing on the human psyche to famous books from authors like Arthur C. Doyle, H. P. Lovecraft, and Douglas Adams.
