Hi there! My name is **Robert C. Raducioiu** and I'm currently working as a `CyberSecurity` consultant in Europe (`Italy`).

I spend part of my free time studying topics like:

- `Malware` Analysis
- Exploit Development
- Binary `Exploitation`
- Active Directory Exploitation

But I'm also interested in other subjects, like Scripting, FrontEnd and BackEnd Development. Sometimes, I also participate in `CTF` (*Capture The Flag*) events, mainly on `HackTheBox`.

Work aside, I'm interested in `Music`: I usually listen to *classical music* from videogame soundtracks and contemporary authors. I also like reading `books`, e.g. Crime novels, Fantasy novels.
